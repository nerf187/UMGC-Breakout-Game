# Breakout Game

## **Software:**

### Python:

    - Download Python from python.org
    - IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python to PATH" if necessary
    - 'python --version' in cmd to check
    - I found it easiest to use Python 3.13.11 but this could subject to change

### Pygame:

    Easy to get errors so here's a few options for cmd line

    - pip install pygame
    - python -m pip install pygame
    - pip install --user pygame
    - I found it easiest to use Pygame 2.6.1 but this could be subject to change

### Github Desktop:

    - Download from desktop.github.com/download/
    - Once signed in, go to File -> Clone Repository or Ctrl+Shift+O
    - Go to the URL tab and paste the groups Git link: https://github.com/nerf187/UMGC-Breakout-Game.git
    - Choose the local path you want Git to operate from. Mine is connected to Documents\Github\Breakout
    - This should populate the main page with whatever is in the repository
    - Create your own branch and publish it if you'd like
